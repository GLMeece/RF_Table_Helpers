# Robot Framework Selenium 2 Extension Library for Table Utilities

Wait, that's too long! How about:

## RF Table Helpers

Yeah, that's a lot easier to say and remember. We'll go with that.

## About

There's not a lot of whiz-bang at the moment. However, I will be building out a set of helper functions to extend what [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/) can do with the [Selenium 2 Library](http://rtomac.github.io/robotframework-selenium2library/doc/Selenium2Library.html). Specifically, utility functions that allow you to introspect HTML tables to determine a column number by way of its header text, find an instance of a value within a table, etc.

## Approach

I'll be using [the approach described in this StackOverflow answer](https://goo.gl/TFPc2Q). This allows you to reference this library only, and not have to reference the Selenium 2 library separately. This also makes it easier to override methods present in the existing Selenium 2 library.

## Documentation

Here's [the main repo web page](http://glmeece.github.io/RF_Table_Helpers/). Not much to look at right now.

Here's what you really want - [the library documentation](http://glmeece.github.io/RF_Table_Helpers/rf_table_helpers.html).
