# Robot Framework Selenium 2 Extension Library for Table Utilities

Wait, that's too long! How about:

## RF Table Helpers

Yeah, that's a lot easier to say and remember. We'll go with that.

## About

As this is the first commit, there's not really anything to see here at the moment. However, I will be building out a set of helper functions to extend what [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/) can do with the [Selenium 2 Library](http://rtomac.github.io/robotframework-selenium2library/doc/Selenium2Library.html). Specifically, utility functions that allow you to introspect HTML tables to determine a column number by way of its header text, find an instance of a value within a table, etc. 

Even though there's no code at the moment, I will deliver something of substance in the weeks to come. How do I know I can do this? Because I've done this very thing before. However, what I wrote as a company-internal code base, I will be creating something new and fresh - hopefully with some lessons learned along the way. Stay tuned!
